# COM3D2.NTRlight.Patcher
Sybaris patcher that makes NTR lock less restrictive

This patcher enables (yotogi and free mode) skills and facilities that are locked by NTRlock while keeping NTR events hidden.



# Pre-requisites
[Mono.Cecil.Inject](https://github.com/denikson/Mono.Cecil.Inject) (included in release)
The patcher requires any plugin/patcher loader that is capable of loading Sybaris patchers. 
For COM3D2 following are known:

[Sybaris 2.1](https://ux.getuploader.com/cm3d2_j/download/68)

[BepinEX 4.0 or newer](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) (personal recommendation, yes I'm biased towards it)

[Sybaris 2.2](https://ux.getuploader.com/cm3d2_j/download/154) is also a possible option, the functionality is not confirmed nor it will be as I'm not fan of it.

#Installaiton
Put archive contents into Sybaris folder
